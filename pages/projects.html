                <p>In terms of functionality, I am proficient in a variety 
                    of programming languages that enable me to breathe life into designs and build 
                    robust applications. Python is my Swiss army knife for backend development, 
                    with its simplicity and versatility allowing me to develop scalable and maintainable 
                    solutions across various domains. JavaScript is my language of choice for frontend development, where I leverage its 
                    dynamic nature and rich ecosystem of frameworks like React and Vite.js to create engaging
                     user interfaces. TypeScript further enhances my development workflow by providing static
                      typing and advanced tooling, ensuring code reliability and facilitating collaboration
                       in larger projects.</p>

                <p>In the realm of design, I bring a versatile skill 
                    set honed through experience and a genuine passion for creating visually
                     appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Figma is my go-to tool for
                      UI/UX design, where I meticulously craft wireframes, prototypes,
                       and high-fidelity designs. With a deep understanding of user behavior
                        and interaction design principles, I ensure that every pixel serves a
                         purpose in enhancing the user experience.  Blender is my gateway to the world of 3D modeling and animation, where I push the
                         boundaries of creativity by crafting immersive environments and stunning visual
                          effects. Additionally, Fusion 360 rounds out my design toolkit, empowering me to
                           seamlessly transition from concept to manufacturing with its comprehensive CAD/CAM
                            capabilities.<br>
