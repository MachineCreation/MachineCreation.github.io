                <h1>Foundations in Labor and Tenacity</h1>
                <p>My formative years in the labor industry were not just about the daily grind;
                     they were the proving grounds for resilience and determination. Amidst
                      the echoing din of a work site, I learned the irreplaceable value of 
                      hard work—a lesson carried through relentless 55+ hour weeks. Balancing
                       the demands of the labor with the rigor of coding school wasn't easy, but
                        it taught me the true meaning of commitment, paving the way for a
                         future I'm determined to build with my own hands.</p>

                <h3>Embracing Challenges: Coding and Climbing</h3>
                <p>When I'm not solving physical puzzles in my work boots, I'm scaling
                     rock faces or delving into the digital world of coding and 3D modeling.
                      These arenas may seem worlds apart, yet they share a common thread—the 
                      joy of creating and the thrill of solving complex problems. Through
                       years of tireless learning and practice, all while managing a
                        demanding work schedule, I've harnessed the same focus and tenacity
                         for my transition into the tech world. Now, standing at the precipice
                          of a career change, I'm as ready to navigate the challenges of software
                           development as I am a rugged bouldering route or a new country's horizon.</p>
